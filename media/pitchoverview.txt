PITCH SCRIPT

Marking Criteria
Solution Viability – Does it work in theory? (15%)
Given the Hackathon prompt (TBA), the judges will need to determine how well the 
solution responds to the problem. This section measures both the idea that each team 
has come up with, as well as how well the final product represents this idea. The 
solution shouldn’t solve the prompt through the re-creation of an already established 
product and should be able to exist in the current marketplace.

Solution Execution – Is it convincing and comprehensive? (10%)
Ideas of reasonable size may not be fully polished in the time limit provided. This
category focuses on how close the team’s product is to doing what it intends to do.
Judges assess whether the project seems complete and if it encompasses the natural 
user requirements that the proposed solution should attempt to solve. This also 
includes “extras” that add to functionality but are not necessarily required for the 
Minimum Viable Product (MVP). 

Technical Sophistication of Solution (35%)
Given that this section is so large we will break it down into further sections:
• Architecture of Solution (10%): Evaluate the tech stack, component integration, 
and whether the architecture is suitable for the solution.
• Feature Development (10%): Assess the complexity and value of the features 
developed, whether small and numerous or large and impactful
• UI/UX Design, Code Quality, and Testing (10%): Judge user appeal, usability, and 
code integrity. 
• Deployment and Code Base Management (5%): Assess Git usage and scalability. 
Bonus marks can be awarded for project deployment.

Note: Technical subsections provide a guide for scoring but are not as rigid as the main 
categories

Group Cohesion and Overall Teamwork (25%)
When submitting their 5-minute presentations, teams must present a workload 
breakdown and timeline, cross-referenced with their Git tree. Judges should assess 
collaboration, integration of components, and how challenges were resolved. Negative 
workflows (e.g. unresolved issues) will impact scores. Input from mentors on team 
dynamics, attitudes, and efforts will also be considered.

Presentation Quality – (15%)
Judges should evaluate presentation structure, pacing, and clarity. Students must 
communicate ideas effectively. 

Note: There is also a separate prize category for best presentation/pitch of their product.

INITAL (SATURDAY)
 - gamifies budgeting

 - mention target audience (students)

 - banking apps hard to understand how you are spending money , all in one list with little info about what the money is spent on

 - use camera or manual input to track your purchases, camera takes picture and we use gemini to get the purchases and prices 

 - this is saved with tags to categorise the purchases, such as entertainment travel, e.t.c. these tags will have some default or the user can make more to be more specific

 - stats about how you are spending money (per tag) (shown with charts, easy to understand)
 
 - set weekly budgets and track saving, use on leaderboard with friends to encourage saving

 - saving goals to help motivate people to save to specific goal

FINAL (WIP)

- most people, especially students have to manage money and save.

- most banking apps only tell you where you spend your money, how much you spent and when, but this doesn't help you figure out what you are spending your money on

- if you want to cut down on the amount of something specific such as confectionary you buy, these systems wont help you


- so we created MyBudget, with out budgeting app you can track every single purchase and categories it using tags, these can be created by the user or auto generated and will allow you to see more accurately what you are spending your money on

- obviously manually inputting every single purchase is cumbersome and so we designed a system that allows you to take a picture of your receipt and it automatically track your purchases, you can still input things manually though so don't worry if you don't have one!

- to help with budgeting you can set a weekly budget and it will calculate how much you spend each week and how much you have saved

- leaderboard 


- tech stack : html, css, javascript, bootstrap, python, flask, sqlalchemy, gemini
